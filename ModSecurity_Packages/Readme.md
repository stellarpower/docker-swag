Copy in the APKs built for the correct Alpine version here.

Note that it's beyond the scope to build these as part of this repository; currently I will build these manually and simply `apk add` these. If you re reading this, I will provide an image for this modified version of SWAG to GHCR so you shouldn't need to do this. With any luck the packages can be merged into Alpine in not too long and this fork can then simply add these to the build recipe.
